      "#Classification\n",
      "One of the main branches of machine learning is classification, where you put data points in two or more groups based on whatever information you have. In this post, I will be using classification for something I have experienced much more than I would like: night-time cloud cover over McDonald Observatory. I am doing this both to learn about the various algorithms available for classification problems, and to prepare some data for a later blog post quantifying observer luck at McDonald Observatory. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's get to it! What data do we have? Well, the observatory has a [weather archive](www.weather.as.utexas.edu) that has quite a bit of information on either 1- or 5-minute intervals. For this project, I will be using the basic weather information, which includes the temperature, pressure, humidity, dew point, and dust counts, as well as the cloud sensor data. Wait, if we have a cloud sensor, why do I need to do any kind of classification you ask? Well, there are long stretches of missing data with the cloud sensor that I want to fill in using the basic data. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before we go on, a quick primer on how the cloud sensor works. What the sensor is actually doing is measuring both the \"sky temperature\" and the ambient temperature. The sky temperature is measured in the mid-infrared, and I imagine is being fit more or less to a blackbody curve. Without clouds, this temperature will be very cold. However, clouds will reflect some of the mid-infrared radiation coming from the Earth itself, and will cause the cloud sensor to measure a warmer sky temperature. The ambient temperature is measured in some much simpler way, since it is just getting the temperature wherever the sensor is physically located. So, a large difference between the sky and ambient temperatures indicates that the sky is clear, while a smaller difference means the sky is cloudy. The suggested values from the [weather site](http://weather.as.utexas.edu/weather_graph/Cloudy.html) are.\n",

      "  \n",
      "So now I have the three classes to use in classification: Clear, partly cloudy, and very cloudy. Let's take a look at the data. For brevity, I will not show every python command that I used to do this analysis; if you want, the ipython notebook with a bit less explanation but all of the code is available [here (POINT TO ACTUAL SOURCE!)](www.github.com). The first thing I do is read in the data files using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).\n",

Now, the basic data has a good amount of missing data, but it is generally short enough timespans that we can fill in the missing data through interpolation or re-calculation. The dew point is missing much more often than anything else, but [is easily calculable](http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/dochelp/QA/Basic/dewpoint.html) from the temperature, pressure, and relative humidity. I just make a new column with the calculated dew point with the following code:\n",

      "basic_data['DEWPT_calculated'] = (Td - 273.)*(9./5.) + 32\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The first and last lines are conversions from Fahrenheit to Kelvin and back, while the middle two lines are doing the actual dew point calculation. I am not quite done with the basic data because it still has a few times that are missing more than just the dew point.

This is the hard part, because it has day- to week-long time spans where the sensor was not working for some reason. Anyone who has looked up knows that the number of clouds in the sky can change on much faster timescales than that, so interpolating is not going to be a very good way to go.

      "Logistic regression is easiest to understand when there are only two classes instead of the three we have here. Then, it is similar to polynomial regression in that you are fitting an equation of the form\n",
      "\n",
      "$ t = c_0 + c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + ...$\n",

      "\n",
      "$ f(t) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}$\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, you fit the parameters $c_0, c_1, ...$, and evaluate the parameters by comparing the value of f(t) to what class the data point is in. The optimized parameters then have the properties:\n",
      "\n",
      "  - points in class 1: f(t) > 0.5 (or some threshold you can play with if you want)\n",
      "  - points in class 0: f(t) < 0.5\n",
      "  \n",
      "To use the logistic function to predict the class, you just plug your data points in to get t, and then use the logistic function to get the probability of being in class 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do we use this for the problem here, where there are three classes? The simplest way is the 'one vs. all' classifier. Basically, you fit three sets of parameters $c_0, c_1, ...$ and each set corresponds to one of the classes. In our setup, you would do normal logistic regression for:\n",

      "  3. very cloudy vs. clear *or* partly cloudy.\n",

This class uses a regularization parameter (C), which is basically just a way to keep the parameters $c_0, c_1, ...$ small and prevents over-fitting. The value to use for regularization depends on the specific data you are using, and so we again use cross-validation to choose it. In this case, there is a [LogisticRegressionCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV.html) class that does all of that for you so I don't even need to do much of anything special.\n",

      "\n",
      "Fitting a decision tree from data is done by splitting each input variable (temperature, pressure, etc) at some value. The number of branches and numerical value of the splits are adjusted until each \"leaf\" only contains points from one class.\n",

      "A random forest is an improvement upon a decision tree. Basically, a bunch of decision trees are all trained at once with random subsamples of the data. To make a prediction, the data is sent through each tree and the total probability is calculated from the ensemble. As you add more trees to the \"forest,\" the result gets more accurate but is also more prone to over-fitting and becomes more computationally expensive. \n",

      "\n",
      "The K-nearest neighbors algorithm is pretty easy to understand: to classify a new data point, you just take several of the points with known labels closest to it, and do a majority vote. If most of the points near the data point are cloudy, for instance, then the new data point will be classified as cloudy. Unlike the other algorithms, K nearest neighbors does not build up any kind of global model that gets applied to the data. Instead, it just uses the training data itself. As with the random forest classifier, we will use cross-validation to choose the 'best' number of neighbors:\n",
